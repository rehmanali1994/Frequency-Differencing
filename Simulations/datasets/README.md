Lastly, [AssembleUSCTChannelData.m](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/blob/main/Simulations/AssembleUSCTChannelData.m) assembles the simulated data from each indivdual transmit/MAT-file in the [Simulations/scratch](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/scratch) folder into a single MAT file containing the full UST dataset in the [Simulations/datasets](https://github.com/rehmanali1994/FrequencyDifferencing/tree/main/Simulations/datasets) folder: kWave_BreastCT.mat (`option = 1`); kWave_BreastMRI.mat (`option = 2`).
